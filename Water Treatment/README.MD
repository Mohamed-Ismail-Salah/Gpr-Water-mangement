Conventional biochemical mechanism-driven approaches are highly dependent on complicated and redundant model parameters, resulting in low efficiency. Besides, sharp increase in business volume of wastewater treatment requires automatic operation technologies for this purpose.  a novel prediction and control framework through  convolutional neural network (CNN)  is proposed for prediction of the WTR. Firstly, the CNN model is utilized to automatically extract the local features of each independent timestamp in the WTP and make them encoded. Next, we conduct a large number of experiments to verify efficiency and stability of the proposed prediction framework.
