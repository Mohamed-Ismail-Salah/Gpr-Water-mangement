## introduction

Flooding is a natural hazard that causes a lot of deaths every year and the number of flood events is increasing
worldwide because of climate change effects. Detecting and monitoring floods is of paramount importance in order
to reduce their impacts both in terms of affected people and economic losses. Automated image analysis techniques
capable to extract the amount of water from a picture can be used to create novel services aimed to detect floods
from fixed surveillance cameras, drones, crowdsourced in-field observations, as well as to extract meaningful data
from social media streams. In this notebooks we compare the accuracy and the prediction performances of recent Deep
Learning algorithms for the pixel-wise water segmentation task.
